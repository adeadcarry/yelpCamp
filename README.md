# yelpCamp
This was my first full-stack application. It is a campground showcase that uses express and mongodb. Making this project helped me get a better grasp on how express and authentication works. It also helped me get more familiar with how everything is connected. It has a few security flaws that could be fixed, but as of right now it's 100% working.
